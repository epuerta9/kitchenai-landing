**Privacy Policy for KitchenAI**

_Last Updated: [10/24/2024]_

OctoIQ LLC ("we," "us," or "our") values your privacy and is committed to transparency regarding the data we collect—or, in this case, do not collect. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we handle information when you use KitchenAI, an open-source project developed by OctoIQ LLC. 

By accessing or using KitchenAI, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use KitchenAI. This Policy may change from time to time, and your continued use of KitchenAI after we make changes is deemed acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

KitchenAI does **not** collect, store, or process any personal information or usage data. We do not track user activity, access IP addresses, or use cookies or other tracking technologies.

### 2. No Data Usage

Since KitchenAI does not collect any information, there is no data usage to disclose. We aim to provide a tool that operates independently of any form of data collection, ensuring that your use of KitchenAI remains private.

### 3. Open Source Community

As an open-source project, KitchenAI’s codebase is freely accessible and modifiable by the community. We encourage transparency and community involvement. Any updates to the project that might introduce new features or services will not include data collection mechanisms unless clearly stated and accompanied by an updated privacy policy.

### 4. Data Security

While KitchenAI itself does not collect or process information, we recommend that users take appropriate measures to secure their own environments when running the software. As an open-source project, the security of your data depends on your local setup and usage practices.

### 5. Children’s Privacy

KitchenAI does not target or offer services to children under 13 years of age. As no data is collected, there are no specific provisions for children’s privacy, but we encourage parents and guardians to supervise children’s use of software and online resources.

### 6. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any substantial changes are made, we will update the date at the top of this Policy. Users are encouraged to check the Policy periodically for any updates.
